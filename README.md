# introduction
hey il make this short i just hope you enjoy this bot. It idenfiies as he/him because i said so. (if anyones interested unless you just want to put this code in your bot)
anyway i also just want to say that i made the database for the shark and it took me forever so i hope you apreciate it and those photos arent mine i just made the folders and put the photos of sharks in them

# annother note
also! most of these things will require external folders so i may make a google drive with all the files in it if anyone wants those files (you are welcome to change them to anything you want as long as you keep the file names the same otherwise it wont work or you will need to change the code)

# about tokens
there is a part of my code that says (TOKEN HERE) and if you try to run my code it will have an error thats because you need to put your actual token there that you can find on the discord developer portal when you make an app and then put a bot on it 

# files needed for my bot
go to files for my bot in my repository to find these files that are in my bot!
* $GUN: requires gun cock.mp3, BANG.wav, and gun dryfire!.mp3
* $lotto: requires YOU WON THE LOTTO MATE!.MP3 and f in chat.wav
* $shark: requires a folder called "cool sharks" containing shark pictures (sorted into subfolders based on shark type)
